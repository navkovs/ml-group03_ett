# ml-group03_ett - Estimated travel time
University group project - backup version without personal information

This is a backup of a group project done in 2021. The group consistet of four people.

The main focus of the project was to learn group management and how to properly do a sprint. Additionally, we used Machine Learning to predict the estimated travel time of two shipping routes in combination with Python and Docker.

Most of the project can be font in the ```group03_ett``` folder. It will however not work, as the data we used to train the ml algorithms is not uploaded, as they were several GiB in size.
